// Setting up webpack//
1) First we install webpack as a dependency.
2) We create the file webpack.config.js.
3) We define the entry point


// Notes //

Entry: 
it is the file that imports everything, it does not export anything. So it is defined
as the entry point of the application.

Also it is the first file to be executed, from here it check which files are the ones
to be imported.


Output:
The output property it is an object with TWO nested properties. We specify a "Path" and
also a "filename".

path: property, reference to the directory that the output file should be saved to.
filename: is what webpack should call the actual file that gets created.
